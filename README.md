Domain/Challenge: EdTech – Adaptive AI Tutor (Bangla & English curriculam)

Project Summary: ShikkhaTutor is an adaptive AI tutor for Bangla and English learners that quickly identifies a student’s weak topics using a short diagnostic quiz and then generates a personalized learning plan. It teaches through short explanations, guided practice, and instant feedback, designed for low-bandwidth mobile use. Teachers or guardians can view simple progress insights like accuracy, attempts, and weak-topic lists. The system uses a curated curriculum knowledge base (RAG) so answers stay grounded and consistent with the syllabus.

Key Features (MVP):
